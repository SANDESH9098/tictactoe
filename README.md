# Tic Tac Toe Game

### Created Using LLM (ChatGPT) - For the Coding Challenge Contest

This project was created entirely using ChatGPT as part of a coding challenge where the primary requirement was to create an application only by prompting an LLM to write and debug the code. This Tic Tac Toe game was completed and deployed by strictly using the outputs generated by ChatGPT without any manual code editing. The goal of the challenge was to practice coding using LLMs and explore how they can assist developers in building applications.

## Overview

This is a **responsive and intuitive Tic Tac Toe game** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS** to provide a clean and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The game includes multiple features to enhance the user experience, including smooth animations, dark/light theme variations, and multiple game modes. Users can enjoy playing against the computer or with another player on the same device.

## Features

- **Responsive and Intuitive Interface**: The game has been designed with a focus on responsiveness and user-friendly navigation. It works seamlessly across different devices.

- **Smooth Animations and Transitions**: Move placement animations, smooth transitions, and a special winning line animation enhance the overall experience of the game.

- **Dark and Light Theme Switcher**: Users can easily toggle between dark and light themes, allowing for a more personalized and comfortable gaming experience.

- **Multiple Game Modes**:
  - **Two Players Mode**: Play with a friend locally.
  - **Player vs Computer**: Play against an AI opponent, providing a challenge to improve your skills.

- **Undo and Redo Feature**: Allows players to undo previous moves or redo them, enhancing the gameplay experience and making it easier to recover from mistakes.

- **Move History Display**: Each player's move history is displayed on the left and right side of the game board, allowing users to track their progress and understand the sequence of moves easily.

- **Visual and Audio Elements**:
  - **Sound Effects**: The game is equipped with sound effects that provide feedback during gameplay, such as move placement and winning notifications.
  - **Winning Line Animation**: When a player wins, a visual animation highlights the winning line, making the game visually rewarding.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building the core structure, styling, and functionality of the game.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for a clean, modern design with simple customization options.
- **LLM (ChatGPT)**: All code for the game was generated through prompts to ChatGPT, from initial creation to debugging and refining features.

## How to Play

1. **Choose a Mode**: Select between "Two Players" or "Player vs Computer".
2. **Pick a Theme**: Toggle between **Dark** and **Light** mode using the theme switcher.
3. **Start Playing**: Players take turns to place their markers (X or O) on the board.
4. **Undo/Redo Moves**: Use the undo and redo buttons to correct or revisit previous moves.
5. **Track Moves**: View the move history on the left (Player 1) and right (Player 2) sides of the game board.
6. **Win the Game**: The first player to get three in a row wins! The winning line will be animated to indicate victory.

## How It Was Built

The entire game was built as part of a contest where the requirement was to only use a language model (ChatGPT) to generate and debug the code. The process involved:
- Prompting ChatGPT to create each component of the game.
- Requesting corrections and adjustments through iterative prompts.
- Ensuring that no manual coding was doneâ€”every line was generated through ChatGPT.

This project serves as a demonstration of how effective and creative an LLM can be in building interactive applications with a detailed and user-friendly experience.
